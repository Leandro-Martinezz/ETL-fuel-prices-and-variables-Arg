# ETL Project:

**Comparative Analysis: International Crude Oil Barrel Price vs. Dollar Price vs. Fuel Price in Argentina vs. Fuel Consumption**

## Considerations

To avoid overcomplicating the analysis of the international barrel price, the **Brent price** will be used as a reference, although other standards exist, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Arab Light crude (OSP).

This project does not aim to delve into complex economic issues, but rather to **simply demonstrate an ETL analysis** where information is extracted from multiple sources, cleaned, and loaded into a SQL database for subsequent analysis.

The main focuses are:
- Code modularity
- Unit testing with pytest
- A robust ETL pipeline

## Variables Analyzed

- Brent Crude Price (USD/barrel)
- Fuel Prices in Argentina (ARS/liter)
- Fuel Sales in Argentina (volume)
- USD/ARS Exchange Rate

## Data Sources

| **Brent Crude Price** | FRED API | API (monthly) |
| **Fuel Prices** | datos.gob.ar | Government CSV |
| **Fuel Sales** | energia.gob.ar | Government CSV |
| **Exchange Rate** | argentinadatos.com | API |
